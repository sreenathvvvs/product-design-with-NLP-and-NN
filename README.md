# product-design-with-NLP-and-NN
This project aims to develop a predictive model that suggests design improvements for mobile devices based on user feedback collected from online reviews of previous models. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and neural network-based modeling, the project seeks to provide actionable insights for optimizing future mobile device designs.

Objectives:
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Extract a large review dataset of online reviews from amazon where users share feedback on mobile devices. Preprocess the textual data by removing noise such as irrelevant symbols, stop words, and redundant information.

Feature Extraction: Implement NLP methods including:
Bag of Words (BoW): To capture word frequency and basic patterns.
Bi-grams: To understand contextual relationships between consecutive words.
Word Embeddings: Employ techniques such as Word2Vec or GloVe to create dense, context-aware representations of words that preserve semantic meaning.

Modeling Approaches:
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): To capture sequential dependencies and extract meaningful patterns from the temporal nature of text data.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): To identify local patterns and relevant features within text sequences, providing robust insights for design features.

Workflow:
Analyze customer sentiments and identify frequent pain points or appreciated features in previous mobile device models.
Use BoW and bi-grams to understand high-level trends while employing word embeddings for nuanced semantic analysis.
Train RNN and CNN models on extracted features to predict which design attributes (e.g., screen size, battery life, camera quality) need improvement or enhancement.

Impact:
This model will enable manufacturers to derive data-driven insights into user preferences, accelerating innovation cycles and ensuring that new mobile devices meet market expectations efficiently.
